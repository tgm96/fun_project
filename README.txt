README:

This is my first project... It doesn't work yet, because the self.has_shield in the player module is broken? or maybe the call in the monsters module on line 189-ish

The idea is to interrupt the monster's attack by prompting the player if they want to block the attack, however, this prompt should only appear if the player has a shield. So, like the armour, I made an attribute in the player class to determine if the player has a shield or not. 

However, when I run the program, it tells me that the Player object has no attribute "has_shield", and I can't for the life of me figure out why...
